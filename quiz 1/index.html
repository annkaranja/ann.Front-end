Uh<br>
Yeah, yeah<br> 
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)<br>
Used to  underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)<br>
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much<br>
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late<br>She used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
In the city where the sun don't set<br>
And every day you know that we ride<br>
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette<br>
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight<br>
We can go anywhere we want<br>
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat<br>
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah<br>
We can do anything if we put our minds to it<br>
Take your whole life then you put a line through it<br>
My love</p>

	        Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength<br> 
	        while loving someone deeply gives you courage<br>
	        There is always some madness in love.<br>
	        But there is also always some reason in madness<br>

	        The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved<br> 
	        loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves <br>

Hello sweet grief,I know you will be the death of me<br>
Feel like the morning after ecstasy,I am drowning in an endless sea<br>
Hello old friend,Here’s the misery that knows no end<br>
So I am doing everything I can,To make sure I never love again<br>
I wish that I did not know,Where all broken lovers go<br>
I wish that my heart was made of stone,Yeah if I was bulletproof<br>
I would love you black and blue,If I was solid like a jewel<br>
If I had a diamond heart<br>
Oh oh<br>
I would give you all my love,If I was unbreakable<br>
If I had a diamond heart<br>
Oh oh<br>
You could shoot me with a gun of gold,If I was unbreakable<br>
I would walk straight through the bullet,Bending like a tulip<br>
Blue-eyed and foolish,Never mind the bruises<br>
Into the fire,Breaking through the wires<br>
Give you all i have got,If I had a diamond heart<br>
I would walk..............<br>
<pre></p><hr>
