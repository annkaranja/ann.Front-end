	<h1 > Am not an early bird....<br>
		Am not a night owl...........<br>
		am some kind of temporarily exhausted pigeon!!!!!!!<br></h1>
<!-- 	<p>
Uh<br>
Yeah, yeah<br> 
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)<br>
Used to  underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)<br>
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much<br>
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late<br>She used to meet me on the Eastside<br>
In the city where the sun don't set<br>
And every day you know that we ride<br>
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette<br>
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight<br>
We can go anywhere we want<br>
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat<br>
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah<br>
We can do anything if we put our minds to it<br>
Take your whole life then you put a line through it<br>
My love</p>
 -->
<p>Here, where the sky's falling,<br>
I'm covered in blue,<br>
I'm running and I'm crawling,<br>
Fighting for you,<br>
When the rain stops,<br>
Then, darling, what will I do,<br>
And I know I go all in,<br>
But why do I,<br>
You give me a reason,<br>
Something to believe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
You give me a meaning,<br>
Something I can breathe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
It's a bittersweet feeling,<br>
Longing and I'm leaving<br>
I go, I go, I go,<br>
But I wish I was there with you,<br>
Oh, I wish I was there with you,<br>
There's a crack in my window,<br>
A bird in my room,<br>
Angels all over,<br>
That watch over you,<br>
When I'm walking on water,<br>
All my dreams have come true,<br>
Still, nothing means nothing,<br>
Without you, you,<br>
You give me a reason,<br>
Something to believe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
You give me a meaning,<br>
Something I can breathe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
It's a bittersweet feeling,<br>
Longing and I'm leaving,<br>
I go, I go, I go,<br>
Tell my heart to lie,<br>
But I know deep inside it's true,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
Oh, I wish I was there with you,<br>
You give me a reason,<br>
Something to believe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
You give me a meaning,<br>
Something I can breathe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
It's a bittersweet feeling,<br>
Longing and I'm leaving,<br>
I go, I go, I go,<br>
Tell my heart to lie,<br>
But I know deep inside it's true,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
Oh, I wish I was there with you,<br>
Longing and I'm leaving,<br>
I go, I go, I go,<br>
Tell my heart to lie,<br>
But I know deep inside it's true,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
Oh, I wish I was there with you,<br>
You give me a reason,<br>
Something to believe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
You give me a meaning,<br>
Something I can breathe in,<br>
I know, I know, I know,<br>
It's a bittersweet feeling,<br>
Longing and I'm leaving,<br>
I go, I go, I go,<br>
Tell my heart to lie,<br>
But I know deep inside it's true,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
That I wish I was there with you,<br>
Oh, I wish I was there with you,<br>
